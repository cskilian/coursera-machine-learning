These scripts are my solutions to the problem sets from Stanford's Machine Learning course offered on Coursera, reimplemented in Python and Numpy
instead of Matlab. To run, refer to the comments in the script about command line arguments. The training dataset should be contained in a CSV file 
with each row containing a training example, and the 1st to (n - 1)th columns containing the features and the nth column containing the output.
